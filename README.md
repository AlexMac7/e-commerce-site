# E-Commerce-Site

The intent is to experiment with using a bootstrap theme and [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/mix#introduction), and provide a starting point in the future for an e-commerce site.

Until this point, my experience in Laravel was almost exclusively back end.  So working with mix and the front end was very enjoyable and interesting.
