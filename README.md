# E-Commerce-Site

This project roughly follows this [CodeMentor](https://www.codementor.io/pknerd/develop-an-e-commerce-website-with-laravel-5-4-part-1-68wfeazqw) series. 

The intent is to experiment with using a bootstrap theme and [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/mix#introduction), as well as providing a starting point in the future for an e-commerce site.

Until this point, my experience in Laravel was almost exclusively back end.  So working with css/js files in mix and blade files was very enjoyable and interesting.

At the moment, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ca) still needs to be implemented, additional cart routes are required and views need adjusted.
